This is a small fun project to play around with PostGIS, spatial queries, JPA 2.0, Android, REST and (of course) Scala... 

Tagger server provides:
* user handling
* location tags (locations with text)
* circle of friends (can exchange location tags and own position)
* REST based interface (with SUNs JAX-RS implementation Jersey) using 
** PostGIS
** Postgresql
** Scala

Mobile App on Android should provide:
* map with actual position (own and friends)
* location tags (own and friends)

 I will post the sources and specs the next days...

Who is interested trigger me ;-)
